# Open Source Hardware Projects
Open source hardware. The projects listed below have gerbers of which PCBs 
can be ordered. The schematics and PCB layouts are created using KiCAD. They can
be read using the KiCAD programs. I prefer OSHPark as my PCB vendor, but use the 
fab you prefer.

* 8-pin 7.5mm X 5.85mm SOIC breadboard adapter.
